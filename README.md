#### Software Licence: This software is available under GPL, which allows free usage and modification - with the restriction that derivative work must be available under the same licence. If you want to adapt this for use as/in a commercial product, contact me to discuss a commercial licence

This software is (at least initially) being developed with a focus on producing homeworks corresponding to the 
syllabuses for the first 3 years of secondary school mathematics in the UK. Pull requests for functionality 
for other subjects / knowledge levels will be appreciated and reviewed, but I won't actively work on them myself.
(reasoning for this is that those are the ages my mother teaches, this is primarily for her use)
